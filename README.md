# verilog_code_inverse_matrix

Code to invert a 5x5 matrix using Gauss-Jordan Elimination method in verilog HDL language.

Here I have atteched .v main modele file and test bench to run the code along with the screen shot of output and assumed main matrix.
This code will work fine for integer numbers.
